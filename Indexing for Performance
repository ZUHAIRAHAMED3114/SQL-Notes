INTRODUCTION
============
Introduction-a
==============
 Index Types 
  Sql Server Contain
	-cluster Row Based
	-cluster column based
	-Non Clustered Index Structure
  Important is Non-Clustered Index
  Reason : They Support More Efficient Access Method For Getting teh data 
	   Rather than lets say doing full table scan

  
 Depending upon the type of Index Uses Casess
  ->  Support a Seek
  ->  Index Scan (Not Table Scan it is doing whole rows)
  ->  Covering a Query (i.e measn your query fetch data will be satisfied with I.e index only
			i.e means for seek,scan the data and fetching will be done from index instead of table)
  ->  Covering multiple Queryies
  ->  Finally supporting the Constraint 
	 (index used as A Constraint) 


 Focus of this course is 
	-> Through Understand on Row Based index
	  -> Evaluate Different WorkLoad Characteristics and Options 
	     Related to SqlServer Versions In Order to know what index 
	     Choices are available

	  -> Why Certain index are affective why certain are not..?
  		visual how index are used
		you can undestand different data access pattern
		
	  -> Explain the cost associated with different indexes 		
		like some indexes are small narrow
		     some indexes are wide adn larger
				
		so we need to understand what are the cost associated
		with those indexes like how much space,
	

	  -> Review and Analyze the internal structure using a variety of tools and command 
		to help troubleshoot the perfromance problem

	      DBCC commands
		DMVs 
		



 2nd Objective
 -> Will understand the Covering indexs
 -> Narrow Index vs Wider Indexe
 -> Which feature is appropriate for dealing with different Query perfromance problem


 i.e makes proactively create more Usefull indexes earlier in your development life cycle..

 3rd Final Objective
 ---------------
  Understand the filter Index 
	very powerful but very limited usecase
	


 understand how to see query plans and have an unmatched filter index warning and how to resolve them
